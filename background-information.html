              Established in 2024, Tesseract was formed with the purpose of utilising
              today's technologies for subgroups in society excluded from the exciting
              technological innovations of our modern era. Brought together in university,
              we realised that we each shared a compassion for technology with positive
              impact as well as an aptitude for software engineering, hence it was only
              natural to combine these traits and start a business that could harness
              both passions for societal good. We began to consider technologically neglected
              communities, specifically those with needs we felt unmet by the current
              level of devices at their disposal. After considering many marginalised
              and vulnerable subgroups, we highlighted the Special Educational Needs
              and Disabilities (SEND) learning community.

            <p style="font-size: 16px">
              Within this sector, most toys and educational tools are simplistic; designed
              purely for resistance to damage and to be cost effective due to general
              lack of funding for SEND children e.g. featureless dolls, building blocks,
              plush toys etc. Another popular product for this community consists of
              sensory devices, designed for giving children sensory stimulation with
              items like lights and textures. Most sensory devices seem to only target
              one of the child's senses and are limited in what various interactivity
              they can have e.g. sensory lights with a single mode, one-style fidget
              devices etc.
              <br>
              <br>
              Due to these mundane devices, educators can sometimes struggle to retain
              a child's attention to their communication or learning task. We’re addressing
              this

              problem with the use of technology to grasp and retain their attention
              for education. By harnessing the children’s need for sensory stimulation
              with modern technology, we can enable educators to deliver lessons and
              communicative exercises with greater ease than traditional methods, while 
              simultaneously allowing the child to have fun while communicating their 
              thoughts, feelings and desires
              <br>
              <br>
              We believe children with additional needs are also deserving of exciting,
              cutting-edge devices to the same capability that neurotypical children
              are provided; devices that are multipurpose for fun and education, ergonomic
              and aesthetic, and that are suitable to their needs. It’s from this belief
              that we have designed TouchTalk.

              To effectively design a product that would meet our objectives, we had to 
              establish our target market. The SEND community is a vast and dynamic
              community, hence to attempt to design a single product to aid and entertain
              all of those under its many sub communities wouldn’t be viable. We broke
              this task down into the following considerations:

            What special needs would we be assisting?
          </button>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Within SEND there are 4 main sub-communities defined by the SEND code
              of practice (2015,DoE): Communication and Interaction, Cognition and Learning,
              Social/Emotional and mental health difficulties, and Sensory and/or Physical
              needs. After researching each of these subgroups and their respective needs
              and existing devices, we settled on Communication and Interaction. Communication
              and Interaction includes children and young people with speech, language
              and communication needs (SLCN) have difficulty in communicating with others.
              This can typically include children and young people with ASD(Autism Spectrum
              Disorder), who are likely to have particular difficulties with social interaction.
              For these children, work is done by educators to provide mediums for communication,
              such as communication boards and cards, to enable them to express themselves
              and interact. We have designed TouchTalk to be another medium for which
              Non-Verbal (NV) children can utilise to communicate in a fun and engaging
              manner.
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">
            What level of sensory stimulation could we provide?
          </button>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              As previously mentioned, sensory toys are used extensively for children
              with ASD. These can involve devices that use lights, noises and even physical
              textures. Understanding the importance of the uses of these devices is
              paramount to our product, and hence incorporating them to provide suitable
              sensory stimulation while producing a unique product to market is our goal.
              Witnessing the popularity of visual stimulation devices for these children,
              as well as being aware of the continual improvements of new age projection
              technologies, we knew we wanted to incorporate a visual projection for
              TouchTalk. Establishing the level of technological resources required to
              provide suitable visual projection that could not only provide educational
              content but keep our product price competitive for the market was key.
              With these considerations, TouchTalk has implemented a visual projector-
              capable of projecting light onto any surface to display educational communicative
              visuals. This visual projection, combined with physical stimulation in
              the form of varying textures surrounding the actual product, allows TouchTalk
              to deliver dual sensory stimulation while still remaining cost effective
              and producing educational content.

          <button class="collapsible">
            How could we guarantee cost effectiveness and secure SEND funding?
          </button>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              The limited government funding for SEND constrains our products production
              cost to a minimum in order to ensure its viability as a mass purchased
              product for the sector. This consideration has made us conscious of our
              production methods and materials, while balancing the cost of resources
              for our technological features and capabilities. With this in mind, TouchTalk
              has been designed to provide entertainment and educational material while
              remaining a durable and long lasting product. We have achieved durability
              and low manufacturing costs by utilising 3D printing manufacturing methods
              with hard-wearing rubber filament to ensure our device can withstand the
              SEND classroom environment.

          <button class="collapsible">
            What SEN educational task could be improved for the greatest benefit of educators?
          </button>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Within Communication and Interaction, a key exercise performed is conversing
              with communication boards. These boards consist of multiple simple designed
              cards which educators will use to ask children questions and observe their
              answers. They are incredibly common and used sometimes with sign language
              or makaton, but educators can sometimes struggle to keep a child sufficiently
              engaged with these boards. As the work being done on providing a communicative
              medium to these children is prioritised, TouchTalk has been created with
              the purpose of acting as an additional medium to communication cards. While
              not designed to completely replace the traditional medium, we aimed to
              allow the device to act as another option for educators when needing additional
              attention on the communicative task by engaging the children with light
              projections of the cards and allowing them to point or touch their designed
              symbol as another way to express their thoughts and intentions. Not only
              would TouchTalk enable continued communication between educators and individuals
              in the class, it holds the attention and wonder of these children for longer
              and can allow these conversations to last longer than if using traditional
              methods.
