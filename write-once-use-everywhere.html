              <p>Historically, web development and mobile app development were wholly separate fields, written in different languages according to different development principles and requiring separate teams to implement. If anything, mobile app development found a closer partner in native desktop app development than in mobile – Java was commonly featured in both, and the design principles were very similar. It would be very surprising, then, to show a developer from 2009 the current state of the industry – not only have web technologies advanced by leaps and bounds from that time, they have moved into not only native desktop app development but are now making serious inroads into mobile app development too. In this blog post, I will briefly detail this journey.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The first step in bridging the gap between web and other areas of development came with the introduction of Electron, which allowed developers to build desktop applications using the web technologies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Electron was originally built in-house for use in the development of GitHub's Atom code editor and provided a way to package web applications as native executables that could run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Some well-known applications built with Electron include Slack, Discord, WhatsApp Desktop, Skype, and Microsoft Teams.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The success of Electron and its sister frameworks demonstrated the potential for web technologies to power more than just browser-based apps. This paved the way for the rise of the "write-once, use everywhere" frameworks that would eventually extend this idea to mobile app development.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Frameworks like React Native, introduced by Facebook in 2015, allowed developers to write fully-featured mobile apps using React (Facebook’s very popular web development framework) and JavaScript, and opened the door for web developers to build mobile apps without having to learn platform-specific languages like Swift or Java. Its use of native components under the hood also meant that React Native apps could achieve native-like performance, resolving contemporary concerns surrounding the use of web technologies for app development. Notable apps built with React Native include Facebook's own mobile apps, Instagram, Skype, Tesla, Walmart, and Bloomberg.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Google's Flutter, released in 2017, took a slightly different approach by using the lesser-known Dart programming language and its own rendering engine to allow developers to build apps for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. While it did require developers to learn a new language, Flutter's hot reload capabilities and rich widget library made it an attractive choice for building performant and visually appealing apps across platforms. Apps like Google Assistant, Alibaba, Tencent, and AppTree have been built with Flutter.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Ionic is a veteran in the "write-once" space, having been in operation since 2013. It provides developers with a compensative toolkit for building mobile UIs, and integrates a great deal of native functionality into its framework. One of its great strengths, particularly in recent years, is its ability to seamlessly integrate with whatever web frameworks a given developer is already familiar with – alongside its own unique front-end offering, developers can also make use of React, Angular, and Vue, which together encompass most of modern web development. Apps like the Sworkit fitness app, the Pacifica self-help app, and the Untapped beer rating app were all built using Ionic.</p>
              <br>
              <p>While each of these frameworks has its own strengths and trade-offs, they are all part of the broader movement to empower developers to build high-quality, platform-tailored experiences while maximising code reuse and productivity.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Looking ahead, the demand for "write-once, use everywhere" frameworks will only continue to grow as businesses strive for greater efficiency and faster time-to-market. We can expect further improvements in performance, developer tooling, and platform integration from these technologies. Moreover, the rise of new computing platforms like augmented and virtual reality will likely only drive further innovation in this space.</p>
              <br>
              <p>While it may seem unlikely today, one can envision a future where all fields of development – web, mobile, desktop, embedded systems, games, etc – are unified under a common set of programming languages and frameworks. Just as web technologies have transcended the browser to power native apps, perhaps a new paradigm will emerge that abstracts away the underlying differences in hardware and platforms. This would enable developers to truly work in a "write-once, use everywhere" manner, focusing on building out their visions without being constrained by the limited scope of just one platform.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Of course, realising such a vision would require significant advancements in language design, runtime performance, and cross-platform compatibility. But as the industry continues to push the boundaries of what's possible with shared codebases and abstraction layers, it's an intriguing prospect to consider.</p>
              <br>
              <p>In the meantime, the current crop of "write-once, use everywhere" frameworks has already revolutionised the way developers can approach software development, unlocking new levels of productivity, consistency, and innovation. And this journey, which began with the humble ambition of bringing web technologies to the desktop, shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
