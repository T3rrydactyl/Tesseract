                  <p class="caption">High School Yard, University of Edinburgh.</p>
                </div>
                <p>As the imposing clock in High School Yard struck 1 pm last Friday afternoon, our fearless team of entrepreneurs convened in Classroom 4, ready to embark on an ambitious cinematic quest – to breathe life into the Tesseract TouchTalk through the magic of film. Little did we know that this endeavour would plunge us into a whirlwind of chaos, sleep deprivation, and moments of sheer hilarity.</p><br/>
                 

                <p>After scripting the trailer and mapping out TouchTalk's features on the whiteboard (which we dutifully captured on film), we decided to reconvene at the University of Edinburgh Main Library's basement at the bewitching hour of 10 pm later that day. In the meantime, I retreated to Appleton Tower, where I toiled away, conjuring up exquisite CAD renderings of TouchTalk in its three radiant hues: Persian Green Space Cadet, Tangerine, and Pink – a kaleidoscope of colours that would make even the most discerning tech enthusiast swoon.</p><br/>
              
                <p>Ten o'clock arrived, and we descended into the library's subterranean realm, only to find our designated study room occupied by a motley crew of squatters. Undeterred, Kyle politely requested their departure, and they obliged, offering profuse apologies for their trespass. With the set assembled – a delightful tableau of an original iPhone, fake plants, and a small mountain of "Development As Freedom" books – we welcomed Anna, our resident lighting maestro, who proceeded to bathe the room in a radiance so intense that it could have doubled as a lighthouse beacon.</p><br/>
              
                <p>With an arsenal of cameras, a solitary tripod, and the unexpected ally of a whiteboard pen holder, we embarked on our cinematic quest. Kyle, devoid of a teleprompter's aid, committed his lines to memory and ditched his glasses to sidestep any troublesome reflections. Anna, ever the motivational force, encouraged me with words of wisdom that would make a drill sergeant blush – a piece of advice that left me in fits of laughter and, surprisingly, infused my performance with a newfound zeal.</p>
                
                <video controls style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; max-width: 600px; border-radius: 20px;">

                </video>
              
                <p>As the night wore on, we encountered a series of obstacles that tested our resourcefulness. The lid of our prototype refused to stay in place, leading Anna to propose soliciting the library's security desk for tape and scissors. Anticipating their possible reluctance to entertain our unusual plea, we instead sought refuge in the first floor UCreate studio. There, a generous classmate provided us with the stationery, equipping us to prevail over the obstacle at hand.</p><br/>
              
                <p>In a moment of sheer amusement, I raced Kyle, Krithikha, and Anna to the basement, only to find myself outpaced by their superior pedestrian prowess. As I rounded the corner, they ambushed me with a jump scare so unexpected that my scream could have shattered glass. Unfazed, we regrouped in our study room, pretending that nothing out of the ordinary had transpired. As we continued filming, Anna's antics escalated, from standing on chairs to drop TouchTalk (much to the fury of the security personnel) to engaging in a spirited game of catch with Kyle, all in the name of capturing the perfect shot.</p><br/>
              
                <p>Finally, as the clock struck 1 am, we triumphed, concluding our night of filming with success… While the others retired EIP work for the night, I ascended to the second floor, with the intention to work on the TouchTalk product page but secretly embarking on a six-hour odyssey of colour grading, editing, and exporting our masterpiece. I ended up leaving the library at 7:45 am, having arrived at 9 pm the previous night.</p><br/>

                  <p class="caption">Moments before being kicked out of Appleton Tower by campus security.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Saturday passed in a blur of well-deserved slumber, but Sunday saw me rising bright and early at 8 am, the first to arrive at the Appleton Tower, where I began crafting an immersive <a href="touchtalk.html">product page</a>  complete with a colour selector that transformed TouchTalk's finishes before my very eyes. Krithikha joined me at 7 pm, constructing an interactive tool that allowed users to dissect TouchTalk piece by piece – a feat that left one of our classmates glacial in their demeanour, undoubtedly consumed by envy at our unwavering dedication.</p><br/>

                <p>As the hours ticked by, Krithikha and I found ourselves chuckling at our frosty classmate's behaviour, particularly when they inquired if their teammate would join them in the library after closing time, only to be met with a resounding "no" – a stark contrast to the unspoken bond that united our own team. Just as we crowned our digital masterpiece with its final touches at 11:30 pm, campus security, in their striking crimson uniforms, swooped in and gave us the boot – apparently, we'd overstayed past the 8pm curfew. But fear not, for our quest was complete, leaving us victorious with our project perfected and our spirits soaring high.</p><br/>
              
                <p>In the end, the Tesseract TouchTalk trailer and webpage was more than just a project; it was an odyssey, a test of our resilience, and a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, laughter can be found in the most unexpected places. And though the road was long and fraught with challenges, the memories we forged will forever unite us in a fellowship of filmmakers, engineers, and, above all, friends who braved the turbulence of creativity to bring something truly extraordinary into the world.</p><br/>
