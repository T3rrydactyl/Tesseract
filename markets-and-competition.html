This is due to the worldwide recognition of those needing and using AAC devices. The American market share is the largest within this evaluation, however, the UK proportion of autistic children and adults to the population is one of the largest in the world and continuing to grow, showing the potential for our market share to increase. Within the global market, the forecasted market value by 2029 is estimated at  0.6 Billion USD by 2029. </p>

                            <li>In Wales, they recorded 63,089 pupils with additional learning needs (ALN) or special educational needs (SEN) in 2023.</li>

From the above statistics, we can estimate the total number of UK SEND children at 1.9 million.</p>

                          <p>The above statistics consider only the total number of SEND children in the UK. However, for TouchTalks' beachhead market, we need to target users of AAC devices rather than individuals on various Education, Health, and Care (EHC) plans.</p>
                          <p>Specific statistics on AAC usage for children within the UK aren't definitive due to it being an under-documented subsection of the autistic spectrum. However, we can consider the following: </p>
                          <br>
                              <ul style="font-size: 16px">
                                  <li>The most common type of need for those with an EHC plan is autistic.</li>
                                  <li> Majority of those with SEN support (59%) have a primary type of need of Speech Language and Communication needs (SLCN).</li>
                              </ul>
                              </p>
                            <br>
                          <p>Considering that AAC is more commonly used with SLCN support and exercises, we can further approximate our market to 1.14 million children across the UK. However, with improved identification of children with ASD and projected global estimation of AAC device users considered in our TAM, we can see this number growing drastically over the next 5 years.</p>

                <li>Tesseract understands the importance of human connection and the appreciation of
                  meeting in person within this digital age, hence for a product aiming to aid such a
                  community of people we would be travelling to potential customers i.e. educational
                  institutions and councils to discuss TouchTalks benefits for SEND children and provide
                  product demonstrations.</li><br>
                  <strong>Website & Digital Ads</strong>
                <li>We would ensure that TouchTalk was suitably advertised online by websites of similar
                  nature to our end users and institutional customers. We would also invest in a strong
                  website detailing TouchTalks functionality and suitability for various end users, with clear
                  instructions for usage and a helpline for educators or parents in need of product
                  assistance.</li>

          <P>At Tesseract, we understand that this product's essential value will be in its ability to provide a
            communicative medium for non verbal/partially verbal children, hence it is important for us to
            respect and listen to educators and specialists feedback regarding our product if we wish it to
            fulfil its true value potential.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            While crafted with intent to educate and provide sensory fun, as we are not the main users of
            TouchTalk we must understand and respect feedback from our end users and educators with
            regards to its usage, and seek to improve the product where we can. We have made this one of
            our company's pledges : to respect, listen and change products in order to provide their greatest
            value to our end users and allow educators to use them with greater ease.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            By communicating this pledge with institutions, educators and parents, we hope to establish
            ourselves as a company that cares about the actual needs of its end users, that can adapt to
            change and is continually working to produce products that truly work, educate and can be used
            with joy.</P>
