# TouchTalk - Holographic AAC Device

## Description
This project was developed as part of the **Entrepreneurship and Innovation Project (2023-2024)[SEM2]** course at the **University of Edinburgh**. Our team was tasked with creating a 'holographic device' that supports the **Human Development Index (HDI)**. We developed **TouchTalk**, a mid-tech Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device designed to improve communication for non-verbal individuals through gesture-driven holographic interactions.

A live preview of the website can be found [here](https://t3rrydactyl.github.io/Tesseract/touchtalk.html).

## Features
- **Gesture-Driven Holographic Interactions**  
  TouchTalk uses cutting-edge holographic technology to project communication tiles onto surfaces, enabling seamless and interactive communication through gestures.
  
- **Projection Specs**  
  - 1000:1 contrast ratio  
  - 30-60" projections  
  - 1000 lumens  

- **Fully Customisable Communication**  
  TouchTalk’s intuitive mobile app allows users to easily select and customise communication tiles. The app includes a diverse selection of tiles, from food items to activities, all tailored for effective communication.

- **Durable, Sensory-Engaging Design**  
  Sold separately is a modular, 3D-printed rubber casing with interchangeable textured panels, providing a customisable sensory experience.

- **Affordable & Accessible**  
  TouchTalk is engineered as a cost-effective solution for Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) funding, making it accessible for schools, families, and institutions.
